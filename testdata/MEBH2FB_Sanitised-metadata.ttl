    ausnc:notes """The informant wasn’t asked where her parents were born, mentions that
grandparents were ‘also in the country’ when she visited London, but they
could have also been travelling. She does however also mention ‘relatives
and friends’ in England. She has been to England and America, and would
really like to go back to America and see a lot more of it.
It should be noted that this conversation consists of anywhere between
five and ten people, both male and female, all talking to each other at
once.  It is practically impossible to determine who is speaking when.
There is a great deal of background noise, and the lines of conversation
transcribed below are merely the parts of the conversation which are picked
up most clearly by the tape recorder.  The codes used for participants
really only identify whether the speaker is male or female, as it is so
difficult to identify particular participants. BH2F and BH2M are not
necessarily the same person the whole conversation, it simply identifies
the speaker as male or female and that the transcriber was unsure who it
was speaking.""";
