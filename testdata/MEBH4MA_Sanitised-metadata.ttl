he was three years old. He returned to Manchester when he was seven, and
again when he was eleven (doesn’t mention the length of time, but says that
he ‘lived in Manchester’). All the members of his immediate family were
born in England. He says that his mother still retains her Manchester
accent, and also speaks French fluently, as she lived in France for a year
when she was eighteen and is still actively developing her skills in the
language.""";
