Australia when she was about twelve. The informant is making plans to visit
Scotland with her mother at the end of Year twelve, and also to live in
England with a friend as she has relatives there as well as some friends
(it doesn’t appear that she has travelled to England or Scotland before)
: this recording was made at school in a noisy, echoing environment.
Comprehensible transcription is minimal as participants talk simultaneously
throughout the recording. Speaker identification is difficult.""";
