from Italy about 20 years ago, and all of his grandparents were born in
Italy. His paternal grandmother still lives in Italy, but he hasn’t visited
and hasn’t met her. His maternal grandparents are in Australia. His parents
speak Italian to each other, his father speaks Italian to him, and he
usually answers in English. He speaks English with his mother. His
grandparents speak Italian to him, and, once again, he usually answers in
English. He learns Italian at school.""";
