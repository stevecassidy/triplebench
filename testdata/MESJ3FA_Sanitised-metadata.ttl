    ausnc:notes """The informant was born in Australia, and her parents were born in Greece
(sounds like they came to Australia when they married). Both parents were
educated in Greece, but left school at grade five level. They don’t speak
very good English, although they use it at work (milkbar). The parents
speak Greek to the children, and the informant answers in Greek, although
she needs some English words. She is the youngest in the family, some 11
years younger than her closest sibling. She only has one grandmother, who
recently came from Greece, and she speaks Greek to her (the grandmother
speaks no English). The informant speaks mainly English to her friends
(with some Greek words). She is learning Greek at school and is proud of
her ‘Greekness’, thinking of herself as Greek.""";
