    ausnc:notes """This informant was born in England (Manchester) and came to Australia when
he was three years old. He returned to Manchester when he was seven, and
again when he was eleven (doesn’t mention the length of time, but says that
he ‘lived in Manchester’). All the members of his immediate family were
born in England. He says that his mother still retains her Manchester
accent, and also speaks French fluently, as she lived in France for a year
when she was eighteen and is still actively developing her skills in the
language.
It should be noted that the recording qualtiy of this tape is rather poor.
The actual recording itself is quite poor, and this is paired with the fact
that the participants are eating dinner at the time of recording and hence
there is a great deal of background noise which makes it even more
difficult to hear the participants’ conversation. """;
